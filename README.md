# TODO:
- [x] ~~Saber coloring is not working, no clue why~~ Fixed in 570914772f868e8a99338fbc1ddf18f0336daeaa
- [ ] Qosmetics support
- [ ] Chroma ring lights do not seem to work due to CJD not providing the customData or something else
- [ ] Light positions in maps such as `Madeon - The Prince` are not correct (assuming the [video from Tempex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0G34tNpbPU) is the reference)
- [ ] Random crash due to retrieving [custom JSON data nullptr](https://github.com/nyamimi/Chroma/blob/c36d5fd48254008786a07c3a2419eac590fc2961/src/hooks/LightSwitchEventEffect.cpp#L57) weirdly
- [ ] Noodle Support
- [ ] Bomb and obstacle coloring
